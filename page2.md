## Bank Marketing: “To ring or Fling?”

**Project description:** I have developed several models which predict which customers are more likely to open a term deposit after being contacted by the bank's marketing team. for a listing given the characteristics of the property. The models range from those based on supervised learning (such as Logistic regression and random forest), and models based on unsupervised learning (such as Principal Component Analysis and k-means) as well as using regularization techniques with Lasso. 

*Business use cases:* In this project we observe a Portuguese bank which had started a marketing campaign to increase their term deposits. The marketing team reached out to potential customers to attract new term deposits but unfortunately, this approach has not been very successful over the past few months. To address this performance issue, I performed predictive analysis to identify the customers who have the highest chance of subscribing to the bank’s term deposits after being contacted by the marketing team.

### 1. The fundamental problem of having an unbalanced target variable

```javascript
if i can type something here (isAwesome apparently ){
  and if return true
}
```

### 2. Data leakage

Call duration is most positivley correlated with our target variable of interest (y), but call duration is not know prior to making a call and thus to marketing so we cannot use it in predictive modelling.  uasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

Relationship of Call duration and subscription rate. We can see as the call duration increases the subscription rate increases (more yes's) 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
